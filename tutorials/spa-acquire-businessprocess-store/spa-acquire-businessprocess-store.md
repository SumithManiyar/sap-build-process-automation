### Explore the store

Packages are categorized by catalog, which let you choose between Automation SDK, Business Content and Learning Content. It also offers a variety of filters, a search feature, and content descriptions to help users find what they are looking for quickly.

1. Navigate to the store in your SAP Build Process Automation tenant.
   
    &nbsp;

    > **Learning Content** offers learning packages to get started with the Application Development tool. These packages allow you to learn best practices by reusing the most common flows to design your first projects.

    > **Business Content** provides pre-built business processes for concrete business problems.

    > **Automation SDK** provides all the Software Developments Kits that can be acquired from the store.
