# Automate Windows Clock Application Using the Recorder
<!-- description --> Automate the creation of alarms in the windows clock application with set and get activities

## Prerequisites
 - A [SAP BTP Free Tier Account](spa-subscribe-booster) with SAP Build Process Automation booster
 - Install and set up the [Desktop Agent 3](spa-setup-desktop-3-0-agent) to run the automation
 - Basic understanding of how to record applications in SAP Build Process Automation

## You will learn
  - How to use the Recorder with the desktop clock application
  - How to read the value of an element during recording
  - How to set the value of an element during recording
  - How to automate the application
  

## Intro
The Recorder allows you to record desktop applications. It enables users to speed up the bot design process. Using the Recorder, actions on the provider application can be recorded, metadata of the screen can be captured and the artifacts can be exported to SAP Build Process Automation. In this tutorial, you will discover two new features of the recorder: 

- Now the Recorder can read the value of an element though the get mode. 
- The recording widget is further enhanced to support the editing of input to the **Set** activity. Once the **Set** activity is generated, you can change the value of the input.

5. Choose **Save**.

    <!-- border -->![Set alarm name](13.png)

    Now, the recording widget is enhanced to support the editing of input to the **Set** activity. Once the **Set** activity is generated, you can change the value of the input if required.

    The input can be of three types. You can provide:

    - hard coded value which is shown inside double quotes.
    - create and assign new variable which is shown with a prefixed '+' symbol.
    - select an input from a list of pre-existing variables.
   
    <!-- border -->![Set alarm name](13a.png)
