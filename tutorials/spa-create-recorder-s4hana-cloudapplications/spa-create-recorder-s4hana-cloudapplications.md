    > ### What is going on?
    > As you will be using the recorder feature, you do not need to create an automation but an application.

    The next step would be to create your application within your project.


### Create your application

Before recording the steps of a workflow, ensure that the Manage Purchase Orders application and the SAP Build Process Automation application are running in a Chrome browser in two separate windows.

1. Open the **Manage Purchase Orders** application in your SAP S/4 HANA Cloud Trial account.

2.  In the **Overview** tab of your **Upload Purchase Order** project, choose **Create**, then choose **Application**.

    <!-- border -->![Application](05.png)

3. In the **Create Application** window, type **Manage Purchase Orders** as an application name and choose **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![Create application](06.png)

    > ### What is going on?
    > SAP Build Process Automation starts detecting the applications and their screens currently running on your local machine. When it's done, you'll see a list of screens in the picker panel on the left.

4.  Select the **Manage Purchase Orders** screen and choose **Next**.

    <!-- border -->![Select web screen](07.png)

    > You have the option to select either **Recorder** type or **Manual Capture** type. This tutorial will show you how to use the **Recorder**.

5. Select **Recorder** as type and choose **Record**.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](08.png)

    > Please note that the technology that you will be recording is **Web**.


### Record your application

After the dependencies have been successfully added, **SAP Build Process Automation** application is locked and you will be directed to the S/4 HANA application you want to record.

The Recorder widget will appear. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use a new feature in the Recorder **Automatic Capture Mode**.  

In earlier versions of the Recorder, when the screen changed in the application, the recorder showed a capture hint. This reminded the user to capture the screen where you had to click on the camera icon to capture the screen. Now, the recorder is enhanced such that, as soon as any screen changes are detected, it automatically initiates the capture and captures the screen.

1. Choose **Record** to start recording.

    <!-- border -->![Record](09.png)

    You can see the **Automatic Capture Mode** is on.

    <!-- border -->![Automatic Capture Mode](10.png)

    You can select the drop down menu to view the different available capture modes such as:

    - Automatic Capture Mode
    - Manual Capture Mode
    - Capture on Hover

    <!-- border -->![Automatic Capture Mode](11.png)

    This step involves recording the setting of the values for  **Supplier**, **Purchasing Organization** and **Purchasing Group**.

    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Supplier           | **`USSU-TRL04`**
    |  Purchasing Organization           | **`1710`**
    |  Purchasing Group    | **`Z10`**

    Once you choose **Record**, the Recorder will capture the screen.

2.  Now choose **Manage Purchase Orders** tile on the page.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](12.png)

    You can see that the activity is added.

    Once a new screen appears, the recorder detects the screen change and initiates the screen capture immediately. First, the recorder waits for the screen to load. Once the screen loads completely, the recorder starts capturing the screen data with green border around the application and capture progress in the recorder.

    > **CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

3. On the **Manage Purchase Orders** application, choose **Create**.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](13.png)

    The recorder will add the new screen with the new purchase order that needs to be created. Now you need to set the values for **Supplier**, **Purchasing Organization** and **Purchasing Group**.

5.  In the **Supplier** input field, choose the **Show Value Help** icon.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](14.png)

    >**CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](15.png)

6.  Search for the **Supplier**: `USSU-TRL04` in the search field and choose **Go**.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](16.png)

7.  Select the **Supplier**: `USSU-TRL04`.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](17.png)

    >**CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

8.  Upon selecting the **Supplier**, the **Purchasing Organization** input fills itself with the correct value automatically.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](18.png)

9.  Now you can repeat the above steps for **Purchasing Group**: `Z90`.


### Record your application - Material Details

This step involves recording the setting of the values for  **Material Details** in a table.

|  Field Name     | Value
|  :------------- | :-------------
|  Material          | **`MZ-FG-M525`**
|  Order Quantity          | **`200`**
|  Order Price    | **`9000`**

1.  Choose **Create**.

    > **CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](19.png)

    A new empty table row is created.

3.  In the **Material** input field, choose the **Show Value Help** icon.

    >**CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](20.png)

4.  Search for the **Material**: `MZ-FG-M525` in the search field and choose **Go**.

5.  Select the **Material**: `MZ-FG-M525`.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](21.png)

6.  Set **Order Quantity** to `200`.

7.  Set **Net Order Price** to `9000`.

    >**CAUTION:** Please wait until the page is fully recorded.

8. Choose **Order**.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](22.png)

    The new purchase order is created.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](23.png)


### Export the recording

1.  Choose the stop button to stop the recording.

2.  To export the recorded steps to **SAP Build Process Automation**, choose the **Export** button.

    <!-- border -->![Recorder](24.png)

    >**CAUTION:** Before you start exporting the recording to SAP Build Process Automation, check if your session has not timed out. If it has timed out, you must re-login (do not refresh) and then export the recording.


### Review the application and the automation

After successful processing, the recorder widget will be closed. You will be redirected to SAP Build Process Automation application and the confirmation message, **Recording successfully exported** is displayed.

The application **Manage Purchase Orders** and the automation **Manage Purchase Orders** are successfully exported.

<!-- border -->![Overview](25.png)

You will find the Declared Application in **Manage Purchase Orders** application. You can view the recorded screens under **Declared Application** and the recorded elements under **Declared Elements**. If required, you can manually edit the screens to add or remove objects.
